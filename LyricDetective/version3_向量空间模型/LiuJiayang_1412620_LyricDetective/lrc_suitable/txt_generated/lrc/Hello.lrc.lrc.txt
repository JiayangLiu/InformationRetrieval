It's me
I was wondering if after all these years 
you'd like to meet to go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal, ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello...
Can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
and a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times 
to tell you I'm sorry 
for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
at least I can say that I've tried 
to tell you I'm sorry
for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello...
How are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself
I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town 
where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret
that the both of us are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (a thousand times)
to tell you I'm sorry
for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
at least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
to tell you I'm sorry
for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore, ooh..

Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Anymore, ooh

Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (a thousand times)
to tell you I'm sorry
for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
at least I can say that I've tried (I've tried )
to tell you I'm sorry
for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
